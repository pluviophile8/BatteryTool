# BatteryTool
[中文](https://github.com/pluviophile8/BatteryTool/blob/master/README.md)

Display battery information (temperature, current, voltage, health status) in the notification bar by initiating a notification, for personal use. Update data every 5000 milliseconds. It takes a few seconds to initialize when starting, please be patient!

I recommend everyone to copy the source code to generate an APK. In this way, you can decide the displayed text and update frequency by yourself !
