# BatteryTool

Display battery information (temperature, current, voltage, health status) in the notification bar by initiating a notification, for personal use. Update data every 3652 milliseconds.

I recommend everyone to copy the source code to generate an APK. In this way, you can decide the displayed text and update frequency by yourself !
